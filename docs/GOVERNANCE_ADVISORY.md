# Governance & Advisory Board

## Governance Principles
GTIXT is governed by:
- methodological transparency
- separation of roles
- versioned changes
- public changelogs

No score can be altered retroactively.

## Advisory Board (future-facing)
**Roles**
- Methodology review
- Risk oversight
- Market expertise
- Ethical supervision

**Profile types**
- former regulators
- quantitative risk experts
- fintech infrastructure leaders
- compliance specialists

Advisory board does not score. It validates methodology evolution.
