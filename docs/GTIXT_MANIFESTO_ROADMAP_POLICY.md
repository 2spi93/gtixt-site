# GTIXT Manifesto, Roadmap, and Data Policy

## I. MANIFESTE GTIXT
**Positionnement historique & doctrinal**

**GTIXT Manifesto — The Global Prop Trading Index**

Markets mature when standards emerge before regulation.

GTIXT was created from a simple observation: the prop trading industry grew faster than its ability to measure itself.

Firms multiplied. Rules evolved. Capital flows increased. But transparency, comparability, and institutional-grade benchmarks did not.

GTIXT exists to fill this gap.

### What GTIXT is
GTIXT is not a trading platform. GTIXT is not a prop firm. GTIXT does not provide capital, signals, or financial advice.

GTIXT is an index infrastructure.

We measure:
- structural integrity
- operational consistency
- regulatory exposure
- survivability
- institutional readiness

Using:
- deterministic methodologies
- auditable data pipelines
- versioned scoring models
- transparent governance

### What GTIXT believes
We believe that:
- Transparency is a measurable property, not a marketing claim.
- Risk exists even when profits are advertised.
- Rules matter more than promises.
- Stability matters more than growth.
- Long-term survivability matters more than short-term incentives.

### Our commitment
GTIXT commits to:
- neutrality
- reproducibility
- auditability
- methodological clarity
- no hidden adjustments
- no discretionary scoring

Every score can be:
- traced
- explained
- versioned
- challenged

### The long-term vision
GTIXT aims to become:
- the Bloomberg standard for prop trading data
- the reference benchmark for institutional actors
- a pre-regulatory transparency layer
- an infrastructure that survives cycles, firms, and narratives

GTIXT does not predict markets. GTIXT measures structures.

GTIXT is not built for hype cycles. It is built for history.

**Purpose:** trust, legitimacy, reference standard.

### Pro Data (Intelligence & monetization layer)
Accessible via subscription, token utility, or institutional agreements.

Included:
- Rule Volatility Index
- Regulatory Exposure Map (detailed)
- Payout Ledger Consistency
- Model Integrity components
- Survivability Score
- Institutional Readiness Score
- Historical score evolution
- Advanced exports
- Full API access

**Purpose:** decision-making, due diligence, research, monetization.

### Internal Data (System protection layer)
Never public.

## Final Strategic Truth
GTIXT is not a site. Not a dashboard. Not a token.

GTIXT is:
- a measurement system
- a risk intelligence layer
- a future standard

Very few projects ever reach this level of coherence. GTIXT is built to.
