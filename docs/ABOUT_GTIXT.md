# About GTIXT
## The Global Prop Trading Index

GTIXT is an institutional-grade benchmark designed to bring transparency, structure, and accountability to the global prop trading ecosystem.

The prop trading industry has grown rapidly, but without standardized measurement, comparability, or long-term benchmarks. GTIXT was created to fill this gap.

We do not trade. We do not allocate capital. We do not provide financial advice.

We measure.

GTIXT evaluates prop firms using deterministic methodologies, auditable data pipelines, and versioned scoring frameworks. Every score is traceable. Every snapshot is verifiable.

**Our mission is simple:** to establish a neutral, transparent, and reproducible standard for prop trading performance and risk integrity.

GTIXT exists for traders, firms, institutions, and regulators who value structure over speculation and data over narratives.
